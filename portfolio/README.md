#A Portfolio Site

This mock portfolio site was made with the help of Bootstrap and a few nifty js libraries. I've wanted to encorporate Typed or similar for a long time-- finally got my chance! Animate on scroll is powerful and still a bit of a mystery to me, but I like what I have working. While I was building this, I came across some interesting functionality that I might work in later, such as waypoints.js.

Using JS packages is a great way to learn DOM methods and workarounds. Check out main.js to see some helper functions that saved me a lot of time. I'll be using those everywhere from now on!
